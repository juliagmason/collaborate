# Resolving error messages.

When you get a conflict message, commit your changes, and then pull. You'll get a warning that there are conflicts that you need to resolve. When you look in your file, there will be conflicts designated by <<<<<<< HEAD and >>>>>>> gibberish. 

Before you can push, you need to choose what from the conflicting text you're going to keep. Delete the offending text and the HEAD stuff. Then you can push (?)

# Boxes go from checks to filled when you stage something and then make further changes.
